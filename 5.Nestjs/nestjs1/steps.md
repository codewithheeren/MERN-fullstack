Nest js is server-side framework which use Typescript.
Nest js is build on top of nodejs and express js.
Modules
Application can have multiple level of modules but we usally take 2 levels of modules only so that application will be less complex.

https://docs.nestjs.com/modules

2- delete all modules except app module.

3- manually create module by copying one module and create the same structure
as showing in nest js documentation.

4- create the module directly by Generate module option .


To make the build - npm run build
In tsconfig.json you can define outDir location of your build.
